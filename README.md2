# Excel Data Cleaning Project – M4ACE Mentorship

As part of my Data Analytics mentorship with M4ACE, we were given a dataset cleaning assignment.

## Objective
Transform a messy dataset into a clean, structured, analysis-ready table using Microsoft Excel.

## Techniques Used
- TRIM() – removed extra spaces
- PROPER() – standardized text formatting
- Concatenation – combined text fields
- Date formatting – corrected inconsistent date entries
- Table formatting – structured dataset for analysis

## Outcome
Before → messy dataset  
After → clean, professional, analysis-ready dataset

This project strengthened my understanding of Excel data preparation fundamentals.
